# Aoife@holidaysplease 


## Project Overview

---
### Website Purpose & Goals:

This website is designed as a business platfrom for a freelance travel agent. It will be used to communicate what she does  and as a medium for people to reach out and contact her. 

The website has four pages which allow users to view latest holiday offers and read about the business owner. The site also provides users with an enquiry form to kick off their holiday consulatation process or direct contact details should they wish to use email or phone instead. The home page is designed to transport the user to paradise and provide good information architecture and navigation system. 

## Functionality and Technologies Used

---
### Functionality
This is a multipage website built using a Bootstrap framework for responsive layout. There is a clean navigation bar which collapses to a hamburger menu when viewing on mobie along with numberous other logical links through out the site. 

The main purpose of this site is to enable the user to easily contact the business owner after being attracted to her services. There are therefore many links to a detailed contact form on the site. This form is disabled for the purposes of the project brief specifies that javascript not be used. 

### Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 
  - Along with using CSS for styling, it has also been used to create a text reveal animation on the homepage. It was decided to hide this feature when viewing on mobile as the screen just looked cluttered and hindered site viewing. 
- Bootstrap - used for responsive layout and collapsable navbar which uses Boostrap's own Jquery

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge the following source of code on which the home page css text reveal animation feature was based:

- Nooray Yemon: https://codepen.io/yemon/pen/dzgmxJ
    - I adapted this piece of code to fit with look and feel of my site. The wording and font was changed along with its placement over a jumbotron to transport the user into the scene of the image. 
    - I also decided after testing its view on mobile to remove the feature from mobile screen size to avoid a cluttered and bad user experience.
